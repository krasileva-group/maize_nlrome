This repository contains scripts used for phylogenetic, sequence diversity, and genomic feature analysis of the Zea mays NLRs from long-read NAM genomes.
The scripts are integrated via a snakemake file which also relies on hmmmer, mafft, and raxml.
The `features` directory includes the scripts associated with analysis of NLR expression and methylation.
