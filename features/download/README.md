## Data Download and QC 

For the RNAseq reads, EMseq reads, and genomes, there are `_info.txt` files including metadata, custom `.py` scripts to complete the download, custom `.ipynb` to monitor which accessions are complete, and `.bash` scripts to run the download on the UC Berkeley Computational Cluster. Then decompression, QC, and `.bed` file generation can take place.
